Project Ideas: 

What we would like to do is build a twitterbot for GW events. What we imagine the project will consist of is first building a scrapper that extracts the daily events from the table listed on the website, download it into a cvs, which we then connect to our twitterbot and it tweets out the days events. We think this is a good project because it has concrete data, it would be useful to GW students as a way of easily checking events, and incorporates mechanisms we've learned in class.
